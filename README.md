A project involves creating a secure and functional web application for user registration and
authentication. The application provides user management capabilities, allowing authenticated users to
interact with user data through an admin panel.

• The frontend is built using React and the Ant Design library. It includes the user management table, toolbar, and
appropriate components for registration, authentication, and user interactions.
• The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, providing APIs for user registration, authentication, user
data management (blocking, unblocking, and deletion), and handling redirects for blocked/deleted users.
• MySQL is used as the database to store user data, including their credentials, status, and other relevant
information.
